#Title H1 - Social engineering and spear phishing

I read an article about effectiveness of social engineering awareness training in mitigating spear phishing risks in financial institutions from a cybersecurity perspective. 
The article was written by Victoria Bukky Ayoola, Ugoaghalam Uche James, Idoko Peter Idoko and Onuh Matthew Ijiga. You can find a link to the article at the end of the text.

I used Google Scholar to find an article written within the last two years. I wanted to read about social engineering, so I ended up with this article which seemed interesting.


•	The key area being researched was how well social engineering awareness training can help to reduce the risk of spear phishing attacks within financial institutions. 

•	It considers how to bring expertise, awareness, and responsiveness to social engineering to the financial sector.

•	Spear phishing - a social engineering - attack is a type of cyberattack that targets an individual to trick them to give sensitive or confidential information about their organization. 
Spear phishing attacks take advantage of its targeting and personalization effect and exploiting human weaknesses. Spear phishing is effective because it exploits human error rather than technology.

•	As spear phishing attacks are an ever-growing problem in the financial industry due to the high value of the data and the possibility to transfer huge amounts of money,
the study focused on how to better identify spear phishing attacks and attempts by training the employees and providing them with regular training on the subject.

•	Research shows that raising awareness significantly reduces the risk of falling victim to a spear phishing attack or similar scam. Raising awareness should be part of the
organizational culture and should be promoted together and through ongoing training.

•	Although studies show that training employees has helped considerably, article leaves open questions about how to keep personnel informed about new attack methods, 
how to train personnel to minimize human error, and how often such training should be organized so that organizations can be as well protected as possible from attacks and 
espionage within a limited training budget and technology.
