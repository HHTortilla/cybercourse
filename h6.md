# Traficom: Cybermeter - User guide:

Summary and checklist of the assessment process describes the five steps from initiating the assessment to perform activities and updating the assessment.

  -	In step one (or 5.1) the company’s management decides to initiate an assessment.
  This is the beginning of the process and it defines the object of the assessment.
 	
  -	Step two (5.2) is when the area of assessment is defined.
  For instance, defined area can be critical, asset, threat, access, situation, response, third-parties, workforce or architecture.
 	
  -	In step three, (5.3) based on the selected evaluation method, the evaluator conducts the evaluation together with other participants.

  -	Step four (5.4) is where the results are analysed. This is the part where development activities are defined.
  
  -	Step five (5.5) - At this point, the organization implements development actions based on the results and updates the assessment.
  In the final stage, a reassessment process can also be initiated if necessary.


3 Cybermeter maturity model
-	The Cybermeter model assesses cybersecurity capabilities and presents them using maturity indicator levels (0–3),
  which represent operations from weakest to strongest.
 	
    -	Level 0: Activities don’t meet the basic requirements.
    -	Level 1: Activities meet basic requirements. 
    -	Level 2: Activities are advanced and more comprehensive than on level 0-2. 
    -	Level 3: Activities are comprehensive, advanced and are steered by organisation’s policy.
  
-	Understanding the concepts of the Cyber Metric is important for interpreting the correct results.
  This part involves four different concepts, the first of which is capability, which refers to the ability to act correctly and use skills and
 	resources to achieve goals.
 	
-	Second concept is the maturity model, that examines activities at different levels with the aim of moving towards more advanced activities.
  These levels represent best practices and are usually in accordance with a law or standard.
 	Each level defines the objectives or requirements that the activity being assessed should meet at a certain level.
 	
-	Third concept is the operational area. This is a concept that refers to socially or organizationally critical services,
  whose cybersecurity is being assessed. The operational area also covers processes, systems and information resources
 	that are critical to the production and provision of services.
 	
-	The fourth area is domains, whose security metric consists of 11 cybersecurity areas, each with its own goals and practices.
  
-	The maturity indicator level calculation model is calculated at three different levels:
  
-	Step 1: Implementation of the policies is assessed with four response options
    -	1. Not implemented
    -	2. Partially implemented 
    -	3. Mostly implemented
    -	4. Fully implemented 

-	Step 2: Target Maturity Indicator Level.
    -	Level 1, 100% of the practices at a given level must be implemented.
    -	Level 2, >50% of the practices at a given level and 100% of the practices at Level 1 must be implemented
    -	Level 3, >50% of the practices at a given level and 100% of the practices at Level 1 and Level 2 must be implemented.

-	Step 3: The maturity indicator level of the areas is determined according to what is set for the lowest maturity indicator.
  The purpose of this calculation model is to emphasize risk management and the importance of the weakest area.
 	You cannot proceed to the next maturity indicator level until all the practices required for the lower maturity indicator levels have been implemented.

-	The Cybermeter maturity report is a report intended for analyzing and reporting assessment results.
  This report is intended for risk management professionals and cybersecurity managers.


  # Make-belief analysis.

  Participants: IT Designer (ITD) and IT Service Manager (SM)
SM: "Hi, as agreed, this week we will review the maturity level of our access management. Have you had a chance to go through the list I sent and mark the maturity levels for each domain?"
ITD: "Yes, I looked through them and found that for the most part things are in order, with a few exceptions. The list was a good reminder to check the accounts of people who have left our organization — there were still several active in different systems. I still gave it a score of 3, since overall it was in good shape."
SM: "And the whole organization already has MFA in use?"
ITD: "Yes, it has been defined as a practice at all levels."

SM: "Thank you. In relation to this, we also had a discussion with the security manager about physical security. The results were somewhat worse. For example, our premises are not externally protected by gates or fences, and it is relatively easy to walk in past the guard. Fortunately, every door is access-controlled, so people cannot move freely inside. We also noticed the need for more regular reviews and updates of access rights."
