Assignment h2 - Scene
https://github.com/HHTortilla/cybercourse/blob/main/h2.md


I had to go back to this assignment once more, because initially I only read the email about the assignment's content, asking me to jump into the "scene". 
Based on this email, I started listening to podcasts relatively enthusiastically, so I completely forgot to check the main homework page, 
where more assignments were opened. 

Because I hadn't followed the assignment properly, the students didn't get to peer-review my work at all.
Afterwards, I did read the blog posts and completed the task as requested.


Otherwise, I didn't have to go back to the texts except to correct spelling and grammar errors.
I tried to focus more on the assignments based on the feedback given by the students, and I feel that this perhaps worked out quite well.
