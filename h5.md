# h5 - Alice and Bob


Chapter 1:
- Cryptography is a term for mathematical function used for secure messaging, or keeping messages secure end-to-end.
- If you want to send a secured message, you can hide it's content with encryption.
- When a receiver gets the message, he/she can use decryption the ciphertext to get it back to readable and understandable form.
- Cryptography is also used for:
          Authentication - The receiver should get confirmation that the sender is who they say they are.
          Integrity - The recipient of the message must be sure that the message has not been altered along the way.
          Nonrepudiation - The sender cannot later deny having sent the message.
- Different levels of algorithms have been developed to protect data in different degrees depending on the value of the data.
- If the algorithm in use cannot be broken with available recourses, it is defined as secure
  
- Encrypted message explained:
      -  Plaintext -> Encryption (with a key)
          -> Turns to Ciphertext
              -> Decryption (with a key)
                   = Original plaintext again in a readable form.
  
- Caesar Cipher might be the most famous or well know classic cipher ever used. Ceasar Cipher is simple subtitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted three positions forward in the alphabet.
- H -> K /  L -> O



Chapter 2:
- Protocol is a sequence of ordered steps with an beginning and end where every step must be done in exact order. It needs two participants to be successful.
- Cryptographic protocol can be used when sharing information which content must not be seen by strangers. The protocol uses cryptography to prevent and detect eavesdropping.

- An example of using protocols:
      Alice (the first participant of protocol) is selling a boat to Bob (second participant of protocol). And Trent is a third participant as a trusted arbitrator.
        Bob wants to pay with a check, but Alice doesn't trust that the check is genuine. At the same time, Bob doesn't trust that he will receive the boat from Alice and doesn't want to give the check without the product. 
           -> A third party can be brought in to act as a neutral party in the interests of both parties, his name is Trent (trusted arbitrator).
              -> Trent acts as a trusted arbitrator between the two parties, verifying that the protocols of both parties meet.
                  -> This protocol ensures that the messages are exchanged in a specific order and each participant knows what to do at each step. Trent acts as a arbitrator to prevent cheating and errors in the process.
- Not all protocols require an arbitrator; some self-policing protocols guarantee fairness and protocol completion without arbitrators.

- A passive attack against a protocol attempts to observe and obtain information, while an active attack seeks to add new messages to the protocol or manipulate the content in some other way.


- Great example is provided to describe public-key cryptography: 
In the example, a symmetric algorithm is described as a safe, to which the key acts as a combination:
Someone who has the combination to the safe can open it, put a document inside it, and close it.
Someone else who has the combination can open the safe and take that document out for themselves.
And someone who does not have the combination is forced to learn how to break the safe.

- Combining digital signatures and public-key cryptography creates a protocol that combines encryption for confidentiality with signatures for authenticity.
- In electronic communication signing before encryption provides added security when attacker can't remove signature from encrypted message and replace it with their own.

A) Pubkey today (Source: Geegs for Geegs)
If I have understood the use of a public key cryptography correctly, over the past couple of days I have used it, for example, when using online banking (TLS/SSL).
- HTTPS-sites use TLS/SSL to encrypt data between me (my browser) and the server.
- Public and private keys ensures a secures session key
- TLS/SSL verifies the identity of the websites using digital certificates signed by trusted authorities.
