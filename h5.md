# h5 - Alice and Bob


Chapter 1:
- Cryptography is a term for mathematical function used for secure messaging, or keeping messages secure end-to-end.
- If you want to send a secured message, you can hide it's content with encryption.
- When a receiver gets the message, he/she can use decryption the ciphertext to get it back to readable and understandable form.
- Cryptography is also used for:
          Authentication - The receiver should get confirmation that the sender is who they say they are.
          Integrity - The recipient of the message must be sure that the message has not been altered along the way.
          Nonrepudiation - The sender cannot later deny having sent the message.
- Different levels of algorithms have been developed to protect data in different degrees depending on the value of the data.
- If the algorithm in use cannot be broken with available recourses, it is defined as secure
  
- Encrypted message explained:
      -  Plaintext -> Encryption (with a key)
          -> Turns to Ciphertext
              -> Decryption (with a key)
                   = Original plaintext again in a readable form.
  
- Caesar Cipher might be the most famous or well know classic cipher ever used. Ceasar Cipher is simple subtitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted three positions forward in the alphabet.
- H -> K /  L -> O



Chapter 2:
- Protocol is a sequence of ordered steps with an beginning and end where every step must be done in exact order. It needs two participants to be successful.
- Cryptographic protocol can be used when sharing information which content must not be seen by strangers. The protocol uses cryptography to prevent and detect eavesdropping.

- An example of using protocols:
      Alice (the first participant of protocol) is selling a boat to Bob (second participant of protocol). And Trent is a third participant as a trusted arbitrator.
        Bob wants to pay with a check, but Alice doesn't trust that the check is genuine. At the same time, Bob doesn't trust that he will receive the boat from Alice and doesn't want to give the check without the product. 
           -> A third party can be brought in to act as a neutral party in the interests of both parties, his name is Trent (trusted arbitrator).
              -> Trent acts as a trusted arbitrator between the two parties, verifying that the protocols of both parties meet.
                  -> This protocol ensures that the messages are exchanged in a specific order and each participant knows what to do at each step. Trent acts as a arbitrator to prevent cheating and errors in the process.
- Not all protocols require an arbitrator; some self-policing protocols guarantee fairness and protocol completion without arbitrators.

- A passive attack against a protocol attempts to observe and obtain information, while an active attack seeks to add new messages to the protocol or manipulate the content in some other way.


- Great example is provided to describe public-key cryptography: 
In the example, a symmetric algorithm is described as a safe, to which the key acts as a combination:
Someone who has the combination to the safe can open it, put a document inside it, and close it.
Someone else who has the combination can open the safe and take that document out for themselves.
And someone who does not have the combination is forced to learn how to break the safe.

- Combining digital signatures and public-key cryptography creates a protocol that combines encryption for confidentiality with signatures for authenticity.
- In electronic communication signing before encryption provides added security when attacker can't remove signature from encrypted message and replace it with their own.


## PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg


First I Installed required tools. 
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install gpg micro psmisc

Then i created a keypair


<img width="787" height="125" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c71e2e7-ed81-43eb-803b-085db3dd92c6" />

Then I exported my public key with cmd 
$ cd
$ gpg --export --armor --output toni.pub
And here is the public key created:


<img width="653" height="117" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b7144d7-4521-4b4c-8b99-31381930f1a3" />


Then I created Alice:
$ cd
$ mkdir alice/
$ chmod og-rwx alice/


And to simulate Alice, I replaced 'gpg' with 'gpg --homedir .' Now Alice has her own settings and own keyring, separate from the one we actually use.

<img width="755" height="272" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b33fd5ad-b288-4c2d-a3e0-50bc9fa7a451" />


I created her own keypair:

<img width="770" height="627" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfa1644e-a899-4639-b00c-d2ebb4e57196" />


Now Alice imports and verifies my public key:

<img width="787" height="255" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46115bcb-5eb5-4bee-9fcd-093eb397a8de" />


Alice can check the fingerprint to verify that this is indeed my key.
$ gpg --homedir . --fingerprint

<img width="670" height="217" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf34ea3a-aec1-4772-8e53-ef82edea5fc1" />


Alice signs my key to mark it as trusted:

<img width="802" height="287" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da8d48e7-95ba-4c09-819e-d4488d159e9e" />


Now I need Alices Public Key to know it's her:

<img width="865" height="247" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02a70af3-d705-4b43-bb9a-ae9945d52412" />


Signing the key to mark this trusted:

<img width="891" height="308" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/108513de-ab9b-40fa-bfeb-f3d5302abeb5" />
And trust is established!


And now Alice sends me a secret message:
$ cd ~/alice/
$ micro message.txt

<img width="512" height="142" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/834d6161-2205-4ea7-9e9f-8d3454e78a03" />


Alice encrypts and signs the message

<img width="897" height="267" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6498faa-43eb-4037-8a17-73516ea76567" />


The lines of gibberish in between is Alice's secret message, encrypted, signed and ASCII armored.

<img width="852" height="153" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e148ee7-2d5e-4a6d-b3f2-faf41fe761a2" />


I tried to copy the encrypted file but it failed every time:

<img width="652" height="61" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08f9387b-1e84-4a23-bc37-171f8a025110" />


Then I decrypted and verified the message

<img width="771" height="322" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42c71f10-67f8-48b0-ab18-5f767d060e04" />





# Other assignments


A) Pubkey today (Source: Geegs for Geegs)
If I have understood the use of a public key cryptography correctly, over the past couple of days I have used it, for example, when using online banking (TLS/SSL).
- HTTPS-sites use TLS/SSL to encrypt data between me (my browser) and the server.
- Public and private keys ensures a secures session key
- TLS/SSL verifies the identity of the websites using digital certificates signed by trusted authorities.


B) Encrypt a message. Explain how different parties use different keys at different stages of operation. Evaluate the security of the tool you've chosen.
- The Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg - will serve as an example for this because there I added so much information to this assignment
- When encrypting the message (confidentiality), only I can read the message. Alice uses my public key to encrypt the message and i use private key to decrypt it. It also shows authentication and integrity when I can verify that the message came from Alice and wasn't modified on the way.


C) Eve and Mallory. In many crypto stories, Eve is a passive eavesdropper, listening on the wire. Mallory malliciously modifies the messages. Explain how PGP protects against Mallory and Eve. Be specific what features, which use of keys and which flags in the command are related to this protection. (Reference Guardian Digital and netwrix)
- PGP uses asymmetric encryption to secure messages (private key and public key)
- Only the recipient of the message can decrypt the message with their private key
- Attackers can't modify the message without breaking the signature


D) Password management. Demonstrate use of a password manager. What kind of attacks take advantage of people not using password managers? (Source Onelogin)
- Dictionary attack, is a method used to guess passwords or encryption keys by systemically trying words from a list of common passwords or words.
- Credential stuffing, where attackers uses stolen username-password pairs. Attackers have obtained leaked passwords or usernames and uses them to gain access to accounts.

Keypass is a great program for managing passwords. You can create a database behind a strong password, where you store a collection of your own passwords. You can add username, password, website URL, and other descriptions to the data that make it easier to find passwords. I tried to take screenshots of the program's installation and use, but (is it a security feature?) keypass went into the background, and I couldn't take a picture.
