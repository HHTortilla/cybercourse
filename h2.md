# H2 - Scene

Second homework was to get in to the Cyber-Scene.

This assignment was returned way past deadline because I didn't notice the changes to originally given topic. Assignment was to get in to scene, which I did. The rest of the assignment was left unfinished because I didn't look at the assignment more closely.

BUT:

For this assignment, you had to listen to a podcast related to the topic.
I went straight to Darknet Diaries and actually ended up listening a bunch of them. 

First I listened a podcast (EP: 144 RACHEL) about Rachel, a social engineer.
Then i went on and listened (EP: 159 VASTAAMO) one about Vastaamo.
I continued to listen these podcasts on my commute; EP: 164 OAK CLIFF SWIPERS and EP: 162 HIEU.

I just finished the episode 162 and next on my list is EP: 156 KILL LIST.

I highly recommend listening to more than one of these. The podcast offers completely new perspectives on cybersecurity, 
and Darknet Diaries will hook you into listening to more than just one.
