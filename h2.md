# H2 - Scene

Second homework was to get in to the Cyber-Scene.

For this assignment, you had to listen to a podcast related to the topic.
I went straight to Darknet Diaries and actually ended up listening a bunch of them. 

First I listened a podcast (EP: 144 RACHEL) about Rachel, a social engineer. This podcast was about Rachel, who unexpectedly became known for her abilities to manipulate people over the phone through a hacking competition.
Her skills to manipulate people is amazing example of social engineering and It made me think about how much information we give out just to a friendly voice on the other end of the phone.
Fortunately, Rachel ended up doing penetration testing for large companies and got to use her ability to manipulate people for good purposes.

I link this directly to my h1-assignment, and actually it's the reason why I wanted to bring this up.
Rachel used tactics similar to those used in spear phishing. She would identify the target of the attack and use the information she gained against the victim. Thanks to her background work, she was very successful at her job and knew how to exploit the vulnerabilities she could find in people through her background work.


Then i went on and listened (EP: 159 VASTAAMO) one about Vastaamo.
I continued to listen these podcasts on my commute; EP: 164 OAK CLIFF SWIPERS and EP: 162 HIEU.
I just finished the episode 162 and next on my list is EP: 156 KILL LIST.
I highly recommend listening to more than one of these. The podcast offers completely new perspectives on cybersecurity, and Darknet Diaries will hook you into listening to more than just one.


Blog: For a blogtext, I chose "AI and the Future of American Politics".
Article was about AI and how it is becoming a multi-purpose equipment in American politics. AI is used to automate targeting, to coordinate movements and citizens to strengthen distrupting processes like voter registration. These AI tools scale routine tasks into powerful political influence and enable new tactics, such as AI avatars and rapid data-driven strategy. Organizers and citizen groups are using artificial intelligence to reach voters and promote workforce mobilization.

And the biggest problems with using AI like this is the uncontrolled spread of disinformation and the potential use of government artificial intelligence to monitor or suppress political speech.
