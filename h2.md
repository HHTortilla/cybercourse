# H2 - Scene

Second homework was to get in to the Cyber-Scene.

This assignment was returned way past deadline because I didn't notice the changes to originally given topic. Assignment was to get in to scene, which I did. The rest of the assignment was left unfinished because I didn't look at the assignment more closely or the assignment changed after I already started it.

BUT:

For this assignment, you had to listen to a podcast related to the topic.
I went straight to Darknet Diaries and actually ended up listening a bunch of them. 

First I listened a podcast (EP: 144 RACHEL) about Rachel, a social engineer. This podcast was about Rachel, who unexpectedly became known for her abilities to manipulate people over the phone through a hacking competition.
Her skills to manipulate people is amazing example of social engineering and It made me think about how much information we give out just to a friendly voice on the other end of the phone.
Fortunately, Rachel ended up doing penetration testing for large companies and got to use her ability to manipulate people for good purposes.

Then i went on and listened (EP: 159 VASTAAMO) one about Vastaamo.
I continued to listen these podcasts on my commute; EP: 164 OAK CLIFF SWIPERS and EP: 162 HIEU.

I just finished the episode 162 and next on my list is EP: 156 KILL LIST.

I highly recommend listening to more than one of these. The podcast offers completely new perspectives on cybersecurity, 
and Darknet Diaries will hook you into listening to more than just one.
