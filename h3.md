# H3 - Hack the hash

H3 Cyber Lab assignment



After I installed Linux on virtual machine, I started working on assignment h3, c) “Crack the hash 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96.”
After a couple of failed attempts with Virtual Machine, I got things going and it was actually pretty fun.

I started with the instructions and installed hashcat: 

$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget
 
To the assignment. First - I got the .txt file from github.com. I followed instructions and got the following results:

Second – I identified the hash type with command: $ hashid -m 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96. 
And at this point I started looking for instructions on how to copy and paste data (hash) into a virtual platform..

Then I tried to crack the hash with cmd $ hashcat -m 0 '6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96' rockyou.txt -o solved – and got this result:

And following the instructions forward I wanted to use –show to see what the password is:
With cmd $ hashcat -m 0 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96 rockyou.txt –show

As we can see, the password is "summer". This was a bit of a challenge as I couldn't see the solved password presented in the task. But a few steps further, I found what I needed in the task using the --show command.


Then I actually asked ChatGPT (YES, AI was used in this assignment) to create a hash for me to crack.
And following previous instructions I got the following hash e5e7105d5c05d9c0cc5944ff1341b533 as MD5:

e5e7105d5c05d9c0cc5944ff1341b533 ended up being “sunflower”
