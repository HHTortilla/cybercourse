# Feed me

x)
- <u>Why use feedreader like RSS/Atom?</u>
- By using RSS/Atom helps to follow several sources without the need to visit websites yourself. 
- It’s quite good way to gather information and stay in touch with your favourite topics. 
- Keep yourself informed about latest trends without browsing through the websites manually.
- Gather every peace of information from one source to a easily readable list.

y) 
- <u>Case Osuuspankkikeskus port scan KKO:2003:36.</u> 
- Suspect A, 17 years at the time, was arrested/charged with attempted databreach to Osuuspankkikeskus (OPK)'s network on nov. 1998.
- A used port scan to find vulnerabilities on OPS's network by scanning all IP-addresses in OPK's network to find open proxy servers but didn't get through the firewall.
- First A didn't get charged from his/hers actions because court didn't find bulletproof facts to back them up. A was only fined with interference of telecommunication.
- Later on court determined that A was indeed performed a port scan with malicious intents to gain unauthorized access.
- Because port scanning gathers information, it qualified as an attempt. A was eventually charged guilty of attempted data breach.
- A ended up paying full compensation from attempted data breach.

a) <u>Install a feed reader.</u> With this, I wanted a code and a script.
Show that it can read a feed (RSS or Atom)

First I installed a Python library needed for this assingment:

<img width="795" height="451" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23f6587a-bac1-4ac0-9f79-59df08898367" />

I added a Python-script, and made it readable with cmd "chmod +x ~/krebson_rss.py":

And voilá, I actually made something cool! Got a list of Krebson security news to my RSS reader:

And then to Schneier-task:
I did all the previous steps (now including photos, because the steps were the same.) I stumbled for a moment when I couldn't figure out how to find the right feed, but I got the result.

Results:

I searched more RSS feeds for this assignment, there's actually a great list of them online:
https://www.cshub.com/rss-feeds

I asked for https://www.cshub.com/rss/webinars and here's the result following the steps of previous RSS scripts:

And one more as asked in assignment:

To jump to task e)
As I said on assignment x) these Feedreaders are incredible easy way to find information without browsing the sites manually. I got everything I wanted just by installing reader. I might try these when riding my Theseus, just to see
where I find myself..
The only downside I found was coding and learning how to script these readers. I would also like to know if there's a way to make these readers visual? Like visually presented to me.
I'm really not a technical guy so I like to see everything presented visually. Is there a way to make these updates to pop up everytime you open your laptop? "Hi T, there's a news for you!"

# Nmap

Next assignment was to install nmap port scanner.
<img width="846" height="438" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b0c9e87-24db-4d4b-95d0-e392f4a31cb9" />

I tried 8.8.8.8 and it shows that 8.8.8.8 are in ignored states

And then port scan my own computer. As I said, I'm not a technical gut so I blurred everything i tought was important..

And then I started installing Daemon.

Went on following instructions, the port 80 changed to Open-state. It's states that Apache started and was listening arrival HTTP-connections:
