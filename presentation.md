# Presentation: Mirai Botnet and DDoS

For this assignment, all students had to make a presentation on a topic of their choice.

I chose the Mirai malware or Mirai botnet and DDoS to my subject as I remember applying to information security trainee role about eight years ago and 
the interviewer showed me a picture of a world map with a lot of dots all around the globe and asked me to describe what I saw in the picture and how it was related to the interview. 
The picture was about Mirai botnet and the large scale of the attacks done within its name. I didn't know how to describe what I saw so the interview was pretty much over at that point.

I left out all the technical specs about the attack, so the presentation was more common introduction to the subject for those who had not heard about Mirai before.

Mirai is a malware that infects networked devices and converts them into bots and these kind of infected devices are used in large-scaled distributed denial-of-services (DDoS) attacks. 
These botnet DDoS attacks can launch floods of traffic exceeding 1 Tbit/s of data (1 Tbit/s is equal to 125 gigabytes per second). 
So the targets are flooded with requests and as the result the rightful users can’t be served, causing service distruption or complete outages.

Mirai targets the Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as printers, wireless modems, routers and even doorbells and other devices. 
It scans the Internet for IoT-devices and IP-addresses and tries to identify vulnerable devices checking them against a list of common default passwords and usernames and logs into them to infect then. 
Mirai infects networked devices that are running Linux operating systems and converts them into bots and the purpose is that the infected devices are used in coordinated, large-scale DDoS-attacks.

And why it still matters after all these years? Originally, Mirai botnets were used mainly for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks 
but the source code of Mirai is still publicly available, and cybercriminals continues to update and replicate it into new variants.
And because of its variants, Mirai is still one of the most influential cybersecurity phenomena of the last few decades, and its mutation has not been stopped, even though its creators have been caught.
